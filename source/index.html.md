# Overview

## API

Create rich profiles of your customers by sending customer data from your external data sources. This API is used to identify customers and create activities within those customers profiles in Local Measure.

There is currently three endpoints in the Local Measure API spec.

## Use Cases

### Wi-Fi splash pages & captive portals

If you are using social media or email sign-in on a splash page or website you can use the API to send identities and sign-in events which creates or updates customer profiles within Local Measure.

### Wi-Fi location analytics

Use the API to create customer profiles and update the customers visit history automatically using the Wi-Fi device location analytics. Visit history powers more relevant search plus automated rules and alerts for repeat visitors.

### Arrival reporting from hotel PMSs

Send arrivals reports into Local Measure by sending guest identities and arrival & departure dates. Include custom fields such as rate codes, special services, package codes etc to provide more detailed contect for the operational teams using Local Measure.

### Loyalty & custom profile data

When identifying a customer in the Local Measure API you are able to send custom fields which give a profile more context and power more sophisticated automations and alerting rules. Creating custom fields such as loyalty level and loyalty ID enable your teams to deliver the right level of service to your guests.

### Link your CRM to Local Measure Customer Profiles

Coming Soon! We will enable you to create a link between customer/guest records in your own CRM or PMS with the Local Measure. Using a unique customer identifier or custom fields you can search and link records between systems.

<aside class="notice">
Use of the API is for customers using the Customer Profiles Add-On. Speak to your Account Manager for more information.

# Authentication

The Local Measure API uses an API key to authenticate access to the API and map data to the correct account. It is available at `https://public-api.getlocalmeasure.com/`.

Local Measure expects an API key in all API requests. We support two methods of sending the API key: HTTP Headers or via a url parameter.

### Header
Include an `Authorisation` header in your HTTP request with your API key

`Authorization: <your-api-key>`

### Parameter
Include the `access_token` parameter in your HTTP uri with your API key as the value

`https://public-api.getlocalmeasure.com/v1/<endpoint>?access_token=<your-api-key>`

You can register a new Local Measure API key in our [plugin portal](http://dashboard.getlocalmeasure.com/account/?tab=plugins).
